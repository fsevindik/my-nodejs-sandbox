# Node.js Scribbles 🗒️

This is my personal Node.js scribble notebook — full of rough notes, test files, code experiments, and random ideas while learning the basics of Node.js.

## ✏️ What is this?

Not a clean tutorial. Not a real project.

Just a bunch of code snippets and short files created while watching tutorials, practicing concepts, or testing how something works.

## 🧪 What's inside?

- `index.js`: Random examples with the `fs` module (sync & async), testing how file operations work.
- `math.js`: A simple custom math module used for testing `require()` and exports. etc. etc.
- server.js fora  primitive server
- -server2.js  server with express

## 🛠️ Practiced Topics

- Reading/writing files in Node.js
- Using `require()` and creating custom modules
- Sync vs async functions
- Playing around with basic Node.js core modules

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is not production code. Just my messy learning playground 😊
